	<h2><center>What is the Yi King?</center></h2>
	
	<p><center>The Yi King (also commonly referred to as the I-Ching) is a system of divination which orginated in Ancient China. Since its popularization by Western scholars starting in the 1800's it has gained worldwide study and practice. This site will focus on the symbolism and meanings each Trigram represents.</center></p>

	  <h2>The Eight Trigrams</h2>
	
	  <p>Each Trigram is composed of three lines, represented by either a broken Yin line (negative) or a straight Yang line (positive). In it's earliest form the consultation of the Oracle of the Yi King produced simple one-lined, yes or no answers represented by either Yin or Yang. As the system developed the practitioners began to discover more elaborate combinations of the lines which led to the intricate system used to this day.</p>
	  <p>The Trigrams are intented to represent everything in Heaven and Earth and the continual transition of one phenomena into another. The Trigrams also symbolize the processes of nature which relate to natural character. Additionally, the Trigrams also have assigned family roles as well. This is not a literal hierarchy as in some cultural myths but rather serves as a metaphorical association. The father and the mother unsurprisingly represent masuline and feminine energy in their purest form. The other six remaining Trigrams are divided equally into three sons and three daughters. The sons represent the principle of movement while the daughters symbolize devotion in it's many forms.</p>	  
      <p>Various methods of consulting the Oracle of the Yi King exist to receive an answer to one's question, the most common through the use of yarrow stalks or coins, but regradless of how you proceed to divine an answer the goal of each method is to produce two Trigrams which are then further combined into a six-lined Hexagram. There are sixty four Hexagrams in total and the complexity and meaning of the Hexagrams further the idea of continual transition which is the overall theme of the Yi King as a whole.</p>	
	  <p>The following section will explain the symbolism of each Trigram in further detail.</p>
